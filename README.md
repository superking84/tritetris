tritetris
=========

A Tetris clone written in Python with Pygame.

This is me trying my hand at a Tetris-style game in Python, using the Pygame
engine.  There's still a lot left for me to finish in the interface, but the
gameplay itself works.

Controls:
Left/right arrow: Moves block from side to side.
Up arrow: Rotate block clockwise.
Down arrow: Pull block down faster (right now you have to press repeatedly, I
            am going to fix so you can just hold the key down)>
"P" key: Pause the game.
    
It's pronounced "Trite-Tris", by the way, not "Tri-Tetris."  That makes it sound
like some kind of triangular Tetris, and I'm definitely more a rectangle-and-square
type guy.
