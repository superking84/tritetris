tritetris
=========

A Tetris clone written in Python with Pygame.

This is me trying my hand at a Tetris-style game in Python, using the Pygame
engine.  There's still a lot left for me to finish in the interface, but the
gameplay itself works.

**Controls:**
-------------
+ Left/right arrow: Moves block from side to side.
+ Up arrow: Rotate block clockwise.
+ Down arrow: Pull block down faster (right now you have to press repeatedly, I
            am going to fix so you can just hold the key down).
+ "P" key: Pause the game.

It's pronounced "Trite-Tris", by the way, not "Tri-Tetris."  That makes it sound
like some kind of triangular Tetris, and I'm definitely more a rectangle-and-square
type guy.

**To-Do List:**
---------------
The following items are things I still want to add to the game, but haven't
gotten to yet.
+ A points system
+ A difficulty level that ramps up with progress (speed-based)
+ Different game modes
