tritetris
=========

A Tetris clone written in Python with Pygame.

I'm currently just in the planning phase, and it's not 100% fleshed out yet.
It's pronounced "Trite-Tris", by the way, not "Tri-Tetris."  That makes it sound
like some kind of triangular Tetris, and I'm definitely more a rectangle-and-square
type guy.
